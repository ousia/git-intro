  "body": "# A Very Basic Introduction\r\n\r\nThese pages are an introductory explanation to `git` aimed to newcomers.\r\n\r\nMy background is not technical. My education is in the humanities. I am only an average computer user.\r\n\r\nI have been using `git` for some years. I donâ€™t use it for programming code, but for texts. And I find this tool extremely useful.\r\n\r\nThe book aims to explain why `git` may help you to manage text files in a better way.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nThe book is available for download for free.
